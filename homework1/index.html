    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="color:#777777;">Hello, my name is Elia, I am 20 years old and I was born in San Luis Potosi, Mexico but I was raised in the US. I live in Eagan, MN. I graduated from the School of Enviromental Studies in 2017. I married my high school sweetheart on November 11, 2017.</p> 
    <p style="color:#777777;">I speak both English and Spanish fluently. I like playing video games on my PS4, spending time with my husband, family, cats, and dogs. 
    <p style="color:#777777;">I also enjoy going on camping trips with my husband and our dogs as much as I like relaxing at home in front of the TV with a movie on. I like horror movies, documentaries, and some dramas.</p>
